\title{Define a relationship between two models}
\usage{
define_relationship(
  local_model,
  local_key,
  type = c("one_to_one", "one_to_many", "many_to_one", "many_to_many"),
  related_model,
  related_key,
  ref = NULL,
  backref = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{local_model}{The model that owns the relationship.}

\item{local_key}{The key in the local model that relates to the foreign key in the related model.}

\item{type}{The type of relationship. Must be one of 'one_to_one', 'one_to_many', 'many_to_one', or 'many_to_many'.}

\item{related_model}{The model that is being related to.}

\item{related_key}{The key in the related model that the local_key relates to.}

\item{ref}{The name to use for this relationship in the local model. If NULL, defaults to the lowercase name of the related model.}

\item{backref}{The name to use for the reverse relationship in the related model. If NULL, defaults to the lowercase name of the local model. If FALSE, no reverse relationship is created.}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns the local_model (although the model is modified in place).
}
\description{
This function establishes a relationship between two models in the ORM system.
It creates a Relationship object and adds it to the local model's relationships.
If a backref is specified, it also creates a reverse relationship in the related model.
As this uses R6 classes, the models are modified in place and do not need to be reassigned.

\examples{
\dontrun{
# Set up models
User <- engine$model("users", id = Column("INTEGER", primary_key = TRUE))
Post <- engine$model("posts", 
                     id = Column("INTEGER", primary_key = TRUE), 
                     user_id = Column("INTEGER"))

# Define a one-to-many relationship from User to Post
define_relationship(User, "id", "one_to_many", Post, "user_id", 
                    ref = "posts", backref = "user")

# Now User has a 'posts' relationship and Post has a 'user' relationship

# Create some sample data
user <- User$record(id = 1)$create()
post <- Post$record(id = 1, user_id = 1)$create()

# Use the relationships
user_posts <- user$relationship('posts')
post_user <- post$relationship('user')

print(user_posts)  # Should show the post
print(post_user)   # Should show the user
}
