Title: Lightweight Object-Relational Mapper for R
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Kent Orr
Maintainer: Kent Orr <orr.kent@pawpawanalytics.com>
Description: oRm is a lightweight, pipe-friendly Object-Relational Mapper (ORM) for R. 
    It simplifies database interactions by allowing users to define table models, 
    insert and query records, and establish relationships between models without 
    writing raw SQL. oRm uses a combination of DBI, dbplyr, and R6 to provide 
    compatibility with most database dialects.
